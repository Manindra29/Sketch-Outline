How to install tool ##name## 

Contributed tools must be downloaded separately and placed within 
the "tools" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find the Processing 
sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the 
Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top. 

Copy the contributed tool's folder into the "tools" folder at this location. 
You will need to create the "tools" folder if this is your first contributed tool. 

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder.
For mac users the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing. 
for windows users the sketchbook folder is located inside folder 'My Documents'/Processing

The folder structure for tool ##name## should be as follows

      src
