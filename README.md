Sketch-Outline
==============

Sketch Outline is a [Processing tool](http://www.processing.org) that provides an outline view of the member variables, functions and classes within a sketch and allows easy navigation between them. 
Similar to the outline view in Eclipse.

Switched to github now from [google code](http://code.google.com/p/sketch-outline/).
